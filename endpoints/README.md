# Serverless Endpoints

This directory contains various endpoints that are designed to be ran on 'serverless' platforms.
Most of the endpoints covered here are too expensive to be ran locally on the backend droplet,
so we are offloading these to a separate platform that is more fit to run these tasks.

Each endpoint will be organized into subfolders, and each endpoint will have Dockerfiles
associated with them.
